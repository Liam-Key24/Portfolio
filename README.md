# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

## Overview

This website is a bold step in my ongoing journey of web development. Crafted with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, this is the **first draft** of what will be an evolving project. 

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The backbone of the site, structuring content and creating a solid foundation.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling faster and more efficient.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.

## Current Status

This is an initial version of the site. It's rough around the edges and very much a work in progress. As I continue to refine and expand it, expect significant changes and improvements.

## What's Next?

- **Design Tweaks**: Better aesthetics and responsiveness.
- **Features**: New interactive elements and content.
- **Performance**: Optimizations for faster load times and smoother interactions.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or join me on this development journey. Your insights are invaluable as I work towards making this project better with each iteration.
